# React-Photo-Gallery

Select photos from my landscape photography displayed on a specific region(US state).
You can select states via an SVG map or drop-down list.

Photos are hosted on flickr and flickr API called for generating images.

# Purpose

The purpose of this project was mostly to become more familiar with React.
This includes the use of mostly React funcational components and hooks.
Ideally passing props when needed.

Secondly using wbepack/babel eventually to compile codebase down into a single JS file that I can
move to a larger project with a NODE backend route to make the API call for me.

lastly interacting with an API for practice.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
